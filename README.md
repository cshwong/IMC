###Introduction to Media Computing, CS1103

This course will teach fundamental programming concepts via creative exercises and small projects. Toward this end, students will explore variables, loops, conditionals, arrays, functions, and programming for multimedia. Data structures and simple object-oriented techniques may also be introduced.

##### Week 3:
* Loops (while)
* Debugging with console output (print value of variable, etc.)
* Interacting with User: Mouse and Keyboard
* Built-in variables: mouseX, mouseY, mouseIsPressed, keyPressed, key
* More Drawing Operations: quad(), triangle(), arc(), random()

##### Week 4:
* Review Loops (while)
